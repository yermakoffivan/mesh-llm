# openai-frontend

Reusable OpenAI-compatible HTTP frontend primitives for mesh and staged runtime
entry points.

This crate owns the public API shapes and route machinery that should not be
duplicated inside `skippy-server`. Stage server code should provide a thin
backend adapter that implements the frontend trait, while this crate handles
request/response JSON, OpenAI-style errors, `/v1/models`, chat completions, and
streaming Server-Sent Events framing. Mesh uses this as the single OpenAI
surface for embedded single-stage and stage-split serving.

Mesh-local compatibility wrappers should stay thin. Request normalization,
Responses API translation, stream-chunk parsing, stream usage conversion, and
upstream error mapping are owned here so the host binary and staged runtimes do
not grow separate OpenAI compatibility layers.

The compatibility target is the mesh OpenAI surface, not llama-server process
compatibility. Request fields such as tools, structured-output shape,
logprobs, and `/v1/responses` are parsed and normalized here; backend support
is advertised or rejected explicitly by the runtime adapter.

For the concrete benchy command and contract, see
[`docs/skippy/LLAMA_BENCHY.md`](../../docs/skippy/LLAMA_BENCHY.md).

## Supported API Surface

| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /v1/models` | Supported | Returns backend-provided model objects with opaque ids such as `org/repo:Q4_K_M`. |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Supported | Handles streaming and non-streaming response shapes. |
| `POST /v1/completions` | Supported | Handles streaming and non-streaming response shapes. |
| `POST /v1/responses` | Supported | Adapts OpenAI responses requests onto chat/completion backend calls and preserves response metadata where possible. |
| `GET /health` / `GET /healthz` | Supported | Lightweight liveness probes for hosts and CI smoke tests. |
| `GET /readyz` | Supported | Backend readiness probe that verifies model discovery through `OpenAiBackend::models`. |
| Server-Sent Events | Supported | Emits OpenAI-style JSON chunks and `[DONE]`. |
| `model` | Supported | Opaque exact-match id; Mesh-style refs such as `org/repo:Q4_K_M` pass through without frontend parsing. |
| `messages` | Supported | String and text-part content are parsed; stage backend applies the model chat template through llama.cpp `llama-common`. |
| `prompt` | Supported | String and string-array prompts are accepted; token prompts parse but are rejected until a backend can honor token IDs directly. |
| `max_tokens` / `max_completion_tokens` | Parsed | Backend decides enforcement. |
| `stop` | Parsed | Backend decides enforcement. |
| `n` / `best_of` | Parsed | Single-choice requests are accepted; multi-choice generation is rejected until the response/backend path supports it. |
| `temperature`, `top_p`, `seed` | Supported | Stage backend passes supported sampling controls to llama.cpp sampling. |
| penalties / `logit_bias` | Supported | Presence/frequency/repeat penalties and token-id logit bias are passed to llama.cpp. |
| `logprobs` / `top_logprobs` | Frontend-compatible | Parsed, validated, and preserved. Backend decides whether logits/probability data can be produced. |
| `tools` / `tool_choice` | Frontend-compatible | Parsed, validated, and preserved. Backend decides whether tool-call generation is available. |
| `response_format` | Frontend-compatible | Text and structured-output shapes are parsed and preserved. Backend decides whether constrained decoding is available. |
| OpenAI-style error envelope | Supported | Includes strict `type`, `param`, and `code` fields. |
| OpenAI-style HTTP fallbacks | Supported | Unknown routes, unsupported methods, invalid JSON, and oversized JSON return the shared error envelope. |
| Request body limit | Supported | Configurable via `OpenAiFrontendConfig`; defaults to 4 MiB. |
| Request IDs | Supported | Reuses only a valid UUID `x-request-id`; missing or invalid values are replaced with a generated UUID. Every response returns the canonical hyphenated UUID and the frontend emits a tracing event with method, URI, status, and request ID. |
| Backend timeout | Supported | Configurable via `OpenAiFrontendConfig`; defaults to 300 seconds and maps timeouts to OpenAI-shaped 504 errors. |
| embeddings/rerank/infill/audio/vision | Out of scope | Not needed for staged text benchmark entrypoints. |

## Shape

    R --> Parse["request parsing<br/>validation<br/>normalization<br/>OpenAI errors"]

```

The backend boundary is intentionally small:

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait OpenAiBackend {
    async fn models(&self) -> OpenAiResult<Vec<ModelObject>>;
    async fn chat_completion(
        &self,
        request: ChatCompletionRequest,
    ) -> OpenAiResult<ChatCompletionResponse>;
    async fn chat_completion_stream(
        &self,
        request: ChatCompletionRequest,
        context: OpenAiRequestContext,
    ) -> OpenAiResult<ChatCompletionStream>;
    async fn completion(
        &self,
        request: CompletionRequest,
    ) -> OpenAiResult<CompletionResponse>;
    async fn completion_stream(
        &self,
        request: CompletionRequest,
        context: OpenAiRequestContext,
    ) -> OpenAiResult<CompletionStream>;
}
```

## Model Identity

`openai-frontend` treats model ids as opaque OpenAI-facing strings. For
Mesh-owned routing, the expected user-facing form is a Hugging Face coordinate
plus artifact selector, for example `org/repo:Q4_K_M`. The suffix is an artifact
selector, not a stage-server topology or serving-backend variant.

Backends should advertise the exact ids they accept through `/v1/models` and
perform exact string matching on requests. Resolution to a concrete Hugging Face
revision, GGUF file, split-shard distribution, local runtime, or staged binary
chain remains backend-owned.

## Backend Responsibility Matrix

## Stage-Server Integration

`skippy-server` and mesh use this crate by implementing `OpenAiBackend` for a
small adapter:

- local text/runtime backend for single-stage smoke tests
- staged chain backend that connects to the first `serve-binary` endpoint

That keeps `serve-openai` and the embedded mesh path thin: parse or build the
runtime config, construct the backend, pass it to `openai_frontend::router`,
and serve the Axum app.

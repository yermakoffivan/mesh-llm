# Usage Guide

Use this operational reference for installation details, setup, service mode,
model storage, and runtime control.

For command-by-command CLI usage, model resolution rules, and JSON automation examples, see [CLI.md](./CLI.md).

## Installation details

Install the latest release executable:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.sh | bash
```

On Windows, use PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

To opt into the latest published prerelease bundle instead:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --pre-release
```

The installer puts `mesh-llm` on your `PATH`. After install, run `mesh-llm setup`
to finish runtime configuration and, on supported macOS and Linux machines,
optionally install the background service.

Source builds must use `just`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mesh-LLM/mesh-llm
cd mesh-llm
just build
```

Requirements:

- `just`
- `cmake`
- Rust toolchain
- Node.js 24 + npm

Backend-specific notes:

- NVIDIA builds require `nvcc`
- AMD builds require ROCm/HIP
- Vulkan builds require the Vulkan development files and `glslc`
- CPU-only and Jetson/Tegra are also supported

For full build details, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Common commands

```bash
mesh-llm setup
mesh-llm serve --auto
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen2.5-32B
mesh-llm serve --join <token>
mesh-llm serve --discover "my-mesh"
mesh-llm serve --model MiniMax-M2.5-Q4_K_M --mesh-guardrails metrics
mesh-llm client --auto
mesh-llm gpus
mesh-llm discover
mesh-llm discover --name "my-mesh"
```

Mesh workflow details live in [MESHES.md](MESHES.md). Big-model split serving
lives in [SKIPPY_SPLITS.md](SKIPPY_SPLITS.md).

If you run `mesh-llm` with no arguments, it prints `--help` and exits. It does not start the console or bind ports until you choose a mode.
Bare `mesh-llm serve` loads startup models from `[[models]]` in `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml`.

## Benchmark tuning

`mesh-llm benchmark tune` measures local model-serving throughput for already-downloaded local models. It resolves local targets, plans safe startup settings, creates temporary per-trial configs, starts isolated local `mesh-llm serve` children, sends OpenAI-compatible chat-completion requests, reports decode tok/s plus setup/readiness/request/shutdown/total timing stats for each context/batch/ubatch/mmap/mlock/flash-attention/speculative-decoding candidate, and keeps trial logs under `target/gpu-tune/`.

Benchmark tune reports the raw highest-throughput trial, the Pareto frontier for decode tok/s versus `ctx_size`, and a recommended trial. By default, the recommendation treats candidates within `10.0%` of the raw best decode tok/s as throughput-equivalent, then chooses the largest context window among those candidates.

```bash
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-8b.gguf
mesh-llm benchmark tune --models /models/qwen3-8b.gguf,/models/mixtral.gguf --json
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-8b.gguf --ctx-sizes 4096,8192,16384 --batch-sizes 1024,2048 --ubatch-sizes 256,512
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-8b.gguf --mmap-values auto,true,false --mlock-values true,false
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-8b.gguf --flash-attention on,off
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-mtp.gguf --speculative-types auto
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-mtp.gguf --speculative-types mtp --debug-telemetry --json
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-mtp.gguf --speculative-types mtp,mtp-ngram,disabled --spec-draft-max-tokens 4,8,16
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-8b.gguf --throughput-tolerance-pct 2.5
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-8b.gguf --apply
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-8b.gguf --apply --replace-existing
mesh-llm benchmark tune --model /models/qwen3-8b.gguf --launch-args
```

If `--mmap-values` is omitted, benchmark tune tries `auto`, `true`, and `false`. If `--mlock-values` is omitted, it tries `false` and only tries `true` when the current mlock limit can cover the evaluated budget. If `--flash-attention` is omitted, flash attention is not varied during the sweep; when supplied (e.g. `--flash-attention on,off`), trial count doubles and the recommendation applies the best flash attention setting.
If `--speculative-types` is omitted, benchmark tune uses `auto`: native MTP and the bounded MTP + request-local N-gram cache composite are tried for MTP-looking targets, locally discoverable draft models are tried when available, and a disabled baseline is included for comparison. Use `--speculative-types mtp,mtp-ngram,draft,disabled` to force an explicit speculative sweep, or `--no-speculative-tune` to run only the disabled baseline.
Use `--apply` to write the recommended settings into `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml`, and combine with `--replace-existing` to overwrite existing writable recommendation fields. `--launch-args` prints generated `mesh-llm serve` arguments for local launch without writing config.
Use `--debug-telemetry` when proving speculative decoding behavior: each trial log includes Skippy debug telemetry, including `llama_stage.native_mtp.*` summary attributes for MTP drafted, accepted, rejected, and accept-rate counts.

Use `mesh-llm gpus detect` when you want to refresh the raw hardware fingerprint, bandwidth, and compute hints rather than benchmark model-serving throughput.

## Setup

Use `mesh-llm setup` after the executable is installed. It configures the native runtime and can install the background service on supported macOS and Linux machines.

See [CLI.md](./CLI.md) for the setup flags and the service options.

## Model catalog

List or fetch models from the built-in catalog:

```bash
mesh-llm download
mesh-llm download 32b
mesh-llm download 72b --draft
```

Draft pairings for speculative decoding:

| Model | Size | Draft | Draft size |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5 (3B/7B/14B/32B/72B) | 2-47GB | Qwen2.5-0.5B | 491MB |
| Qwen3-32B | 20GB | Qwen3-0.6B | 397MB |
| Llama-3.3-70B | 43GB | Llama-3.2-1B | 760MB |
| Gemma-3-27B | 17GB | Gemma-3-1B | 780MB |

## Specifying models

`mesh-llm serve --model` accepts several formats. Hugging Face-backed models are cached in the standard Hugging Face cache on first use.

```bash
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen3-8B
mesh-llm serve --model Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M
mesh-llm serve --model https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF/resolve/main/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
mesh-llm serve --model bartowski/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-GGUF/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
mesh-llm serve --gguf ~/my-models/custom-model.gguf
mesh-llm serve --gguf ~/my-models/qwen3.5-4b.gguf --mmproj ~/my-models/mmproj-BF16.gguf
```

## Startup config

`mesh-llm serve` also loads startup models from `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml` by default.

Use the persisted TOML for future starts or reloads. It does not rewrite active
sessions in place, and request payload values still win over any request
defaults from the file.

## Request logging

The embedded console includes a local **Logs** tab for request history,
details, and bounded maintenance operations. It is not a public mesh service:
the log routes accept trusted-local management access only. The request ledger
shows active requests and terminal outcomes, and uses a dedicated log event
stream with an authoritative REST refresh and bounded polling recovery when
needed. Ledger filters are applied through REST hydration; only supported
request-ID filters are sent to the stream, and the last cursor is reused when
the stream reopens. A host without the logs capability remains inert rather
than retrying the old status stream.

Logging retains metadata by default. Redacted artifact capture is an explicit
configuration choice and never restores data that was not captured. For
retention, exports, scoped cleanup, webhook retry, privacy, and recovery
guidance, use [LOGGING.md](LOGGING.md).

## Runtime mode and daemon lifecycle

The `[runtime]` section controls daemon-level behavior: operating mode, startup
failure policy, drain timeouts, and opt-in host activity adaptation.

```toml
[runtime]
mode = "serve"                        # "client" | "serve" (default) | "on_demand"
startup_failure_policy = "best_effort" # "best_effort" (default) | "fail_fast"
drain_timeout_secs = 30               # 1..=3600, default 30
drain_timeout_max_secs = 300          # 1..=3600, default 300, must be >= drain_timeout_secs

[runtime.activity]
enabled = false                       # opt-in, default false
idle_after_secs = 300                 # 30..=86400, default 300
poll_interval_secs = 5                # 1..=60, default 5
resume_debounce_secs = 30             # 0..=300, default 30
response = "pause_remote"             # "pause_remote" (default) | "pause_all" | "reduce_priority"
advertisement = "coarse_state"        # "none" | "availability_only" | "coarse_state" (default) | "private_coarse_state"
```

### Operating modes

- **`serve`** (default, also when the field is absent): the daemon starts mesh
  gossip, discovery, tunnels, management, owner-control, OpenAI ingress, and
  plugins before resolving models. Configured and CLI models load eagerly as
  startup intents.
- **`client`**: read-only safety boundary. The node joins the mesh and routes
  requests but never serves local models. Persisted `client` mode conflicts
  with explicit `serve` or `--model`/`--gguf`/`--mmproj` flags and fails
  **before** listeners start. Remediation: change the config mode to `serve`
  or `on_demand`, or remove the model flags.
- **`on_demand`**: the daemon starts worker-capable but idle. Configured models
  are preference/candidate metadata, not eager intents. Models load only when
  explicitly requested through local commands, owner-control lifecycle
  commands, advisory mesh demand, or explicit CLI `--model`/`--gguf`
  arguments. Explicit CLI models remain eager startup intents.

### Startup failure policy

- **`best_effort`** (default): continue starting if a configured model fails to
  load. The daemon stays alive and degraded; the error is logged.
- **`fail_fast`**: abort startup if any eager startup model fails to load.
  Applies **only** to eager startup intents. The daemon waits for terminal
  outcomes, then orderly closes listeners and metadata and exits nonzero with a
  bounded summary. Owner and advisory failures never kill the daemon.

### Drain timeout

- `drain_timeout_secs` (default 30): seconds before forcibly unloading a
  draining instance after new work is rejected.
- `drain_timeout_max_secs` (default 300): maximum allowed drain timeout cap.
  Per-command overrides are capped by this value.
- Force drain uses deadline 0 (immediate unload).

### Host activity policy

Activity adaptation is **opt-in** (`enabled = false` by default). When enabled,
the daemon detects host activity and adapts inference admission:

- `idle_after_secs` (default 300): seconds of inactivity before transitioning
  to idle.
- `poll_interval_secs` (default 5): how often to poll the activity detector.
- `resume_debounce_secs` (default 30): seconds to wait after activity resumes
  before re-enabling admission.
- `response`: what to do when activity is detected:
  - `pause_remote` (default): reject new inbound QUIC HTTP and stage transport
    work; local API/OpenAI/plugin work continues.
  - `pause_all`: also reject local OpenAI/plugin model dispatch. Management,
    owner-control, health, status, and unload/drain remain reachable.
  - `reduce_priority`: keep admissions open and invoke the best-effort priority
    controller. May surface degraded status on failure.
- `advertisement`: how to advertise admission state to mesh peers:
  - `none`: emit nothing.
  - `availability_only`: publish hosted/serving availability as
    explicitly-known-and-empty while non-admitting.
  - `coarse_state` (default): emit the admission enum and also publish
    known-empty availability for old peers.
  - `private_coarse_state`: emit the enum only on private meshes; use
    known-empty availability publicly.

**Platform support**: unsupported or headless platforms report `Unknown` and
never infer idle. Manual override (`Auto`/`Active`/`Idle`) is session-only and
not persisted in config. `reduce_priority` is best-effort: it captures the
original process state, applies only through a safe platform capability, and
restores on idle/shutdown.

**Privacy**: no raw owner payloads, input events, app/window names, usernames,
idle durations, timestamps, or detector errors appear in gossip, public status,
logs, or telemetry. Only the coarse admission enum and known-empty availability
are advertised.

### Daemon states

`/api/status` includes an optional `runtime.daemon_state` field derived with
this precedence:

1. `stopping` — shutdown in progress
2. `degraded` — terminal failure or priority restoration failure
3. `ready_serving` — local model serving inference
4. `ready_proxying` — healthy remote/plugin route, no local serving
5. `ready_idle` — listeners ready, no models loaded
6. `starting` — not yet ready

Coexistence is represented by capability booleans (`worker_capable`,
`local_serving`, `proxying`, `plugin_ingress`, `accepting_local`,
`accepting_remote`), not extra enum combinations.

### Runtime status and activity API routes

- `GET /api/runtime/intents` — filtered intent list, capped at 256 entries.
  Shows durable/configured and session intents, but never raw owner payloads or
  detector details.
- `GET /api/runtime/activity` — current activity policy status.
- `PUT /api/runtime/activity/override` — set manual override (`auto`/`active`/`idle`).
- `DELETE /api/runtime/activity/override` — restore auto.

### Compatibility

Additive defaulted TOML needs no config-version bump. Canonical config still
travels as TOML. Public `/0` and `/1` ALPN remain unchanged. Owner-control ALPN
remains unchanged. Old peers treat missing admission as eligible (legacy
behavior). New lifecycle commands may return typed `CONTROL_UNSUPPORTED` on
older hosts.

#
# [plugin.startup]
# connect_timeout_secs = 75
# init_timeout_secs = 90
# optional = true
# lazy_start = true
```

Use the default config:

```bash
mesh-llm serve
```

If no startup models are configured, `mesh-llm serve` remains alive as a
healthy zero-model daemon. It reports `ready_idle` while no local, plugin, or
remote route is available, and can load a model later without restarting.

Or an explicit path:

```bash
mesh-llm serve --config /path/to/config.toml
```

Config precedence:

- Request values override per-model config, which override `[defaults.*]`, which
  override family or topology policy, which finally override built-in runtime
  defaults.
- Request defaults only fill missing or null request fields at the OpenAI
  frontend boundary. Explicit request values win, and those defaults never
  become `StageConfig`, runtime load structs, protobuf payloads, or lower-layer
  runtime settings.
- Explicit `--model` or `--gguf` ignores configured `[[models]]`.
- Explicit `--ctx-size` overrides configured `ctx_size` for the selected startup
  models.
- Explicit `--mesh-guardrails <disabled|metrics|enforce>` seeds the
  server-side mesh guardrail mode for hosted Skippy startup models and later
  runtime-loaded models.
- `mmproj` is optional and only used when that startup model needs a projector
  sidecar.
- `skippy.*` staged-serving controls stay staged-only. `activation_wire_dtype`,
  prefill controls, speculative draft controls, and manual stage layer ranges
  apply only when the model is started in staged mode.
- `safety_margin_gb` resolves to `hardware.fit_target_mib` by subtracting the
  reserved MiB from detected allocatable memory, and the derived target is not
  written back into TOML.
- Changing this file affects future starts or reloads, not active sessions.
- Plugin entries stay in the same file.
- `[plugin.startup]` controls how long mesh-llm waits for an external plugin to
  connect and initialize. `optional = true` records a missing installed plugin
  as inactive instead of rejecting the config, and `lazy_start = true` defers
  process launch until direct plugin use. This is useful for very slow legacy
  hosts or emulator-assisted startup paths.

## Speculative decode configuration

Configure speculative decoding under `[defaults.speculative]` for all staged
models, or under `[models.speculative]` to override one configured model. CLI
flags have the highest precedence, followed by the selected model, then
`[defaults.speculative]`; package strategies supply the remaining declared
defaults. The resolved plan is validated once before Skippy starts.

Set `strategy = "auto"` to use a package recommendation, `"disabled"` for
the no-speculation baseline, or `"mtp"` for native MTP. A package may also
publish stable names such as `mtp-cache`; that name is valid only for the
package that declares it. Direct GGUF serving can use `ngram-cache` or
`ngram-suffix` when it supplies valid N-gram bounds.

```toml
[[models]]
model = "meshllm/GLM-4.7-Flash-MTP-GGUF:Q4_K_M"

[models.speculative]
strategy = "mtp"
ngram_min = 2
ngram_max = 4
ngram_max_proposal_tokens = 6
extension_max_tokens = 6
verify_window_min_tokens = 1
verify_window_max_tokens = 6
verify_window_pipeline_depth = 2
```

`ngram_min` and `ngram_max` determine the history match length.
`ngram_max_proposal_tokens` is separately the maximum continuation length.
The request-local cache is limited to `ngram_max <= 4`. N-gram settings may run
standalone or, with native MTP, form one composite proposal. All combinations
are verified together by the target, so tuning these values changes speculative
work, not output correctness.

The `suffix` proposer is a pure-Rust longest-suffix matcher
("prompt-lookup decoding"). Unlike `cache` it is not bound by
llama.cpp's 4-token match window, so it can match long verbatim repeats in the
context (up to `ngram_max <= 64`) and copy long, high-confidence drafts. It is
designed for input-grounded, repetitive workloads — re-emitting a file with a
small edit, echoed tool output, repeated identifiers — and stays silent when no
sufficiently long match exists. Benchmark the target workload before assuming
an uplift or neutrality on freeform prose. `ngram_min` is the minimum verbatim
match length before it drafts; draft length scales with match length up to
`ngram_max_proposal_tokens`.

```toml
[models.speculative]
strategy = "mtp"
ngram_proposer = "suffix"
ngram_min = 5
ngram_max = 32
ngram_max_proposal_tokens = 48
extension_max_tokens = 48
verify_window_min_tokens = 1
verify_window_max_tokens = 32
verify_window_pipeline_depth = 2
```

Suffix can also run without MTP by setting `strategy = "ngram-suffix"` and
omitting the extension controls. Layer packages may declare `ngram-suffix` as
a request-local proposer and standalone strategy. See
[Suffix N-gram Proposer](skippy/SUFFIX_NGRAM_PROPOSER.md) for the lookup
contract, telemetry, and benchmark requirements.

For package-authoring rules, see
[Layer Package Repositories](specs/layer-package-repos.md#generation-defaults).
For strategy diagrams, CLI overrides, and the VerifyWindow telemetry used to
evaluate a configuration, see
[Pipelined VerifyWindow Decode](skippy/PIPELINED_VERIFY_WINDOW.md).

## Lemonade integration

Use the `openai-endpoint` plugin to route requests to a local [Lemonade Server](https://lemonade-server.ai) through the same `http://localhost:9337/v1` API that mesh-llm exposes.

Start Lemonade first, either with the Lemonade Desktop app or with the CLI:

```bash
lemonade-server serve
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/v1/models | jq '.data[].id'
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
mesh-llm plugins install openai-endpoint
```

You can also install directly from GitHub:

```bash
mesh-llm plugins install Mesh-LLM/openai-endpoint
```

Then enable the plugin in `~/.mesh-llm/config.toml`:

```toml
[runtime]
mode = "on_demand"

[[plugin]]
name = "openai-endpoint"
url = "http://localhost:8000/api/v1"
```

Plugins that declare a host-projected web UI may independently disable that
console projection while leaving the plugin process and endpoint behavior
enabled:

```toml
[[plugin]]
name = "example-plugin"
enabled = true
web_ui_enabled = false
```

`web_ui_enabled` is meaningful only for a plugin that declares a web UI. It
does not install, start, stop, or disable the plugin process.

If you are running the plugin binary yourself instead of using
`mesh-llm plugins install`, set `command = "openai-endpoint"` in the same
plugin block.

Start mesh-llm normally:

```bash
mesh-llm serve
```

No `[[models]]` entry or placeholder local model is required. `on_demand`
prevents any configured local models from loading eagerly while preserving the
ability to load one later.

After startup, mesh-llm should include Lemonade-hosted models in its own model list:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9337/v1/models | jq '.data[].id'
```

Requests sent to mesh-llm with a Lemonade model ID are forwarded to Lemonade:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9337/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "hello"}
    ]
  }'
```

Notes:

- mesh-llm does not start or supervise Lemonade; run it separately with the Desktop app or CLI.
- Use the exact model ID returned by Lemonade's `/api/v1/models`.
- mesh-llm passes the configured URL to the plugin through `MESH_LLM_PLUGIN_URL`.
- Plugin-process health and Lemonade endpoint health are separate; verify both
  before reinstalling the plugin.

Useful model commands:

```bash
mesh-llm models recommended
mesh-llm models installed
mesh-llm models search qwen 8b
mesh-llm models search --catalog qwen
mesh-llm models show Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF/Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf
mesh-llm models download Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF/Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf
mesh-llm models package unsloth/Qwen3-8B-GGUF:Q4_K_M --dry-run
mesh-llm models updates --check
mesh-llm models updates --all
mesh-llm models updates Qwen/Qwen3-8B-GGUF
mesh-llm models cleanup
mesh-llm models prune
```

## Model storage

- Hugging Face repo snapshots are the canonical managed model store.
- Managed model scans use Hugging Face repo snapshots.
- Arbitrary local GGUF files still work through `mesh-llm serve --gguf`.
- Skippy materialized stage GGUFs are derived cache and can be preview-pruned
  with `mesh-llm models prune`.

Model downloads validate the Hugging Face Hub cache and Xet working cache
before worker threads start. If either location is read-only, mesh-llm warns
with the original operating-system error and uses a writable application-data
directory instead. `MESH_LLM_DATA_DIR` chooses that fallback root;
`HF_HUB_CACHE` and `HF_XET_CACHE` configure the two caches directly.

## Inspect local GPUs

```bash
mesh-llm gpus
mesh-llm gpus --json
mesh-llm gpus detect --json
```

This prints the local GPU inventory with stable IDs, backend device names, VRAM, unified-memory status, and cached bandwidth when a benchmark fingerprint is already present. Add `--json` for machine-readable inventory output, or run `mesh-llm gpus detect --json` to refresh the cached fingerprint and print the benchmark summary as JSON.

## Local runtime control

Local hot load and unload target the running daemon on this machine.

```bash
mesh-llm load Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M
mesh-llm unload Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M
mesh-llm status
mesh-llm runtime guardrails --mode enforce --port 3131
```

Management API endpoints:

```bash
curl localhost:3131/api/runtime
curl localhost:3131/api/runtime/processes
curl -X POST localhost:3131/api/runtime/models \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M"}'
curl -X DELETE localhost:3131/api/runtime/models/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-Q4_K_M
curl -X POST localhost:3131/api/runtime/mesh-guardrails \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"mode":"enforce"}'
curl -s localhost:3131/api/status | jq '.runtime.openai_guardrails'
```

The guardrail mode update is also node-local. It changes the shared
server-side `GuardrailPolicy.mode` without restarting the process, so existing
hosted Skippy backends and future local runtime loads observe the new mode.
Single-owner remote load, ensure, unload, and drain are available through the
explicitly targeted owner-control commands below. Autonomous mesh-wide
placement and rebalancing remain future work; owner-control is not a public
mesh-wide load/unload mechanism.

## Owner-control plane

Owner-control is the private operator lane for commands directed at exactly one
owner-attested node. It does **not** replace the public mesh plane used for
join, gossip, routing, or inference. Config and inventory mutation are
exclusive to `mesh-llm-control/1`; the old mesh-plane config stream IDs are
reserved but no longer carry protobuf request/response handling.

`scan-refresh` is the first public owned-node command. It asks the explicitly
targeted remote node to rescan its managed model inventory, republishes the
model names from that exact scan, and returns the refreshed inventory to the
requester. The compatible protobuf operation remains named
`refresh_inventory` on the wire.

### Bootstrap contract

- New control clients need an explicit owner-control endpoint token. The token
  identifies and cryptographically pins one target; it is not inferred from a
  peer ID, public gossip, Nostr, routing state, or `/api/status`.
- Read a target node's local bootstrap policy from
  `GET /api/runtime/control-bootstrap` or
  `mesh-llm runtime bootstrap --json` on that node, then transfer the endpoint
  token to the controlling node out of band.
- The controlling node must have a valid owner key for the same owner. The
  target verifies requester ownership against the actual QUIC connection
  identity before dispatching a command.
- If no explicit endpoint is supplied, the current client contract returns `ControlEndpointRequired`.
- If an explicit endpoint is configured and fails, the client stays on owner-control and reports a structured failure. It does **not** silently fall back to mesh-plane config streams.

### Transport and fallback matrix

| Caller / target | Result |
|---|---|
| New client + explicit endpoint | Use `mesh-llm-control/1` only; no silent legacy downgrade |
| New client + no endpoint | `ControlEndpointRequired` |
| New client ↔ old node with no endpoint | `ControlEndpointRequired` by default |
| Old client + new node | Legacy mesh-plane config stream IDs are reserved but rejected as unsupported/unknown |
| Old node ↔ new node public mesh join/routing | Public mesh ALPN negotiation, gossip, and routing remain compatible; owner-control is not required for join/routing |
| Old client + old node | Unchanged old-node behavior outside this release |

### Operator commands

Inspect the local bootstrap policy:

```bash
mesh-llm runtime bootstrap --port 3131 --json
curl -s localhost:3131/api/runtime/control-bootstrap | jq .
```

Run owner-control requests through the local management API using an explicit endpoint token:

```bash
mesh-llm runtime get-config --port 3131 --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --json
mesh-llm runtime scan-refresh --port 3131 --endpoint '<control-endpoint>'
mesh-llm runtime scan-refresh --port 3131 --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --json
mesh-llm runtime apply-config \
  --port 3131 \
  --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' \
  --expected-revision 7 \
  --config /absolute/path/to/config.toml \
  --json
```

Owner lifecycle commands create session-only intents on the target node. They
never mutate durable config or TOML — use `apply-config` for persistent changes.

```bash
mesh-llm runtime load-model --port 3131 --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --model Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M
mesh-llm runtime unload-model --port 3131 --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --model Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M
mesh-llm runtime ensure-model --port 3131 --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --model Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M
mesh-llm runtime drain-model --port 3131 --endpoint '<control-endpoint>' --model Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M
```

- `load-model`: one-shot present intent. Returns accepted lifecycle state.
- `ensure-model`: maintained present intent with bounded retry. Survives
  transient load failures for the session.
- `unload-model`: absent intent. The model is unloaded.
- `drain-model`: draining-then-absent intent. Already-admitted work finishes;
  new work is rejected. Unloads at zero in-flight or force-cancels at the
  configured drain deadline.

Legacy hosts that do not implement these commands return typed
`ControlUnsupported`, not a silent fallback to the public mesh.

```

The local REST facade is loopback-only. The public CLI spelling is
`runtime scan-refresh`; the old `runtime refresh-inventory` spelling remains a
hidden compatibility alias and continues to return the legacy config snapshot.
Neither facade discovers a target implicitly: both require `--endpoint` (or
the REST `endpoint` field).

### Scan-refresh result

The JSON response contains `target_node_id`, `disposition`, and `inventory`.
Inventory entries are sorted by `canonical_model_ref` and contain an optional
`display_name`, `total_size_bytes`, and optional compact model metadata. The
metadata includes the canonical model key plus GGUF-derived architecture,
quantization, tokenizer, dimensions, RoPE, special-token, and MoE fields when
known. `--json` prints this response unchanged; human output summarizes the
disposition, target, model count, total bytes, and sorted model references.

`disposition` is `executed` when this request performed the scan and
`coalesced` when it joined an already-running scan. Joined callers receive the
same successful inventory payload. A new client talking to an older
owner-control server may receive only the legacy wire snapshot; the command
still succeeds, but the REST fields `disposition` and `inventory` are `null`
and human output labels the result `compatibility-limited`. This does not mean
released nodes support the richer response fields.

Scan failures are returned to all joined callers and preserve the last good
inventory and model advertisements. Rich inventory results stay on the private
owner-control response path: they are not copied wholesale into peer state,
public gossip, runtime status, or `/api/status`. Endpoint tokens and raw command
results must not be logged or advertised. The node continues to publish only
its existing availability projection from a successful scan.

### Owner-control limits

- Inbound and outbound protobuf frames are limited to 8 MiB. An oversized
  generated response becomes `ControlUnavailable` before any oversized body is
  written.
- Client connect, stream-open, handshake, and request-write waits are bounded
  at 8 seconds, 2 seconds, 2 seconds, and 2 seconds respectively.
- Get/apply unary responses have a 5-second bound; inventory scans have a
  30-second bound. Watch acceptance has a 5-second bound, after which an
  accepted watch remains streaming without a unary deadline.
- The server bounds handshake and request reads at 2 and 5 seconds and admits
  at most 32 concurrent owner-control stream workers per connection.
- Request IDs are non-zero. Authentication, requester binding, target binding,
  request validation, deadline selection, and response-size enforcement occur
  in the common dispatcher path.

### Failure modes

| Error | Meaning | Typical operator action |
|---|---|---|
| `ControlEndpointRequired` / `control_endpoint_required` | No explicit endpoint was supplied | Read `runtime bootstrap`, then retry with the advertised endpoint token |
| `ControlUnsupported` / `control_unsupported` | Target accepted the connection path but does not speak `mesh-llm-control/1` | Verify the endpoint token targets an owner-control listener |
| `ControlUnavailable` / `control_unavailable` | Endpoint token, listener, network path, or local owner key loading failed | Verify the endpoint token, listener status, and local owner keystore/passphrase |
| `Unauthorized` / `unauthorized` | Same-owner handshake failed | Check that both nodes use the same owner identity and that the local key can be unlocked |
| `RevisionConflict` / `revision_conflict` | Apply request used a stale `expected_revision` | Re-read config, merge, and retry with the current revision |
| `LegacyJsonUnsupported` / `legacy_json_unsupported` | A legacy mesh-plane frame hit `mesh-llm-control/1` | Fix the caller to use owner-control protobuf frames |

### Transition note

Treat owner-control as the only lane for operator config and inventory clients. Legacy mesh-plane config stream IDs remain reserved for compatibility bookkeeping, but current nodes do not handle config subscribe/push requests on `mesh-llm/1`.

### Mixed-version QA harness

Use the task harness when you need executable evidence for mixed-version routing or owner-control bootstrap:

```bash
scripts/qa-control-plane-mixed-version.sh \
  --released-binary ./target/qa/released/mesh-llm \
  --current-binary ./target/debug/mesh-llm \
  --evidence-dir .sisyphus/evidence
```

Loopback-only routing/owner-control smoke:

```bash
scripts/qa-control-plane-mixed-version.sh \
  --released-binary ./target/qa/released/mesh-llm \
  --current-binary ./target/debug/mesh-llm \
  --evidence-dir .sisyphus/evidence \
  --local-only
```

Owner-control bootstrap lane only:

```bash
scripts/qa-control-plane-mixed-version.sh \
  --released-binary ./target/qa/released/mesh-llm \
  --current-binary ./target/debug/mesh-llm \
  --evidence-dir .sisyphus/evidence \
  --local-only \
  --config-only
```

To validate the harness contract without starting processes or writing evidence, add `--print-plan`; it prints the planned public, loopback, and owner-control result names as JSON.

`--config-only` skips public-mesh probes and focuses on the owner-control migration lane:

- loopback released/current private-mesh coexistence in both directions
- current-branch proof that new clients prefer `mesh-llm-control/1`
- current-branch proof that missing endpoints fail with `ControlEndpointRequired`
- current-node `runtime bootstrap` / `runtime get-config` evidence when owner-control is enabled

Each real run writes a timestamped evidence directory with `manifest.json`, `commands.jsonl`, `results.jsonl`, `summary.md`, `summary.json`, `versions/*.txt`, process logs, and grouped status/model/chat/control payloads.

If the local bootstrap payload reports `enabled=false`, the harness records a `PREREQ` result explaining that a signed same-owner keystore is required before runtime owner-control requests can be proven on that machine. That is an explicit prerequisite report, not a silent pass.

Per-crate docs stay with their crates. The main binary crate overview lives at
[../crates/mesh-llm/README.md](../crates/mesh-llm/README.md), and the web
console/embedded asset crate overview lives at
[../crates/mesh-llm-ui/README.md](../crates/mesh-llm-ui/README.md).
Shared protocol-facing model/type ownership lives at
[../crates/mesh-llm-types/README.md](../crates/mesh-llm-types/README.md).
Shared owner identity and envelope crypto lives at
[../crates/mesh-llm-identity/README.md](../crates/mesh-llm-identity/README.md).
Shared wire protocol ownership lives at
[../crates/mesh-llm-protocol/README.md](../crates/mesh-llm-protocol/README.md).
Shared routing target ownership lives at
[../crates/mesh-llm-routing/README.md](../crates/mesh-llm-routing/README.md).

Developers migrating from backend-linked release commands should use the
host/runtime/product commands in
[design/NATIVE_RUNTIMES.md](design/NATIVE_RUNTIMES.md#development-loop-boundary).
Installed and portable products keep their selected runtime beside the neutral
host or in the documented package-owned directory, with the user cache only as
a fallback.
